# Biometric Authentication from Keystroke Dynamics

Here the authentication will be done via a part of keystroke dynamics which will compare the flight time between each two key presses.

It will calculate the average difference in the delay of flight times between key strokes which you register and login, and based on a certain threshold, it will make the decision on whether the user is authenticated or not. 

It will also take the _name_ which you provide into account.
